Amazon Web Services (AWS)

This repo contains information related to AWS used on my website

**ami_notes** - for advanced users - this directory contains my personal notes for how I created the AWS Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) used in my website.  I write these notes for two reasons: 1) so I can remember how I created them, and 2) so advanced students who want the experience of creating them manually can do so.  If you are new to Linux, it's best to just launch virtual machines based on my AMIs rather than trying to manually create them.
