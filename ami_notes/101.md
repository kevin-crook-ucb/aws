## My personal notes for creating the KevinCrook.com 101 AWS AMI

**Purpose:**  AMI to provide Ubuntu with Docker so students can launch an AWI image of any size and run Docker images into containers or clusters.  

### Ubuntu Server

As of August 2018, when this was made, AWS was only supporting Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS "Xenial".  
(note: 18.04 LTS "Bionic" has been out for 4 months, but not yet certified for AWS.)

Here is the image used:

Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-759bc50a

Launched details:
* N. Virginia Region
* t2.large - 2 CPUs, 8 GiB RAM, 9 cents an hour current pricing
* 100 GiB storage, $10 a month current pricing
* security Group I named 101, open ports: 22 (ssh), TBD
