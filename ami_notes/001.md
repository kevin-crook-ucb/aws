### My personal notes for creating the KevinCrook.com 001 AWS AMI

This AMI provides the following:

* Ubuntu Server - AWS does not provide any Linux desktops

* Lubuntu Desktop - allows students to run the desktop in the cloud

* RDP - remote desktop protocol - allows students to connect to the Lubuntu Desktop using Microsoft Remote Desktop

* Chrome Browser - allows students to run Jupyter Notebook, etc.

* Anaconda distribution: Python 3.x and 2.x, R, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda Navigator, etc.

* SageMath - both command line and activation for Jupyter Notebook

* Docker - this should allow students to run any Docker images used in any of their classes, including Hadoop, Spark, etc.

* git - command line counterpart to GitHub

### Ubuntu Server

As of August 2018, when this was made, AWS was only supporting Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS "Xenial".  18.04 LTS "Bionic" has been out for 4 months, but not yet certified for AWS.

Here is the image used:

Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-759bc50a

Launched details:
* N. Virgia Region
* t2.large - 2 CPUs, 8 GiB RAM, 9 cents an hour 8/2018 pricing
* 100 GiB magnetic storage, $5 a month (not SSD which would be $10 a month)
* security Group I named 001, open ports: 22 (ssh), 443 (https used by remote desktop)
