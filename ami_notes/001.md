### My personal notes for creating the KevinCrook.com 001 AWS AMI

This AMI provides the following:

* Ubuntu Server - AWS does not provide any Linux desktops
* Lubuntu Desktop - allows students to run the desktop in the cloud
* RDP - remote desktop protocol - allows students to connect to the Lubuntu Desktop using Microsoft Remote Desktop
* Chrome Browser - allows students to run Jupyter Notebook, etc.
* Anaconda distribution: Python 3.x and 2.x, R, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda Navigator, etc.
* SageMath - both command line and activation for Jupyter Notebook
* Docker - this should allow students to run any Docker images used in any of their classes, including Hadoop, Spark, etc.
* git - command line counterpart to GitHub

### Ubuntu Server

As of August 2018, when this was made, AWS was only supporting Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS "Xenial".  
(note: 18.04 LTS "Bionic" has been out for 4 months, but not yet certified for AWS.)

Here is the image used:

Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-759bc50a

Launched details:
* N. Virginia Region
* t2.large - 2 CPUs, 8 GiB RAM, 9 cents an hour current pricing
* 100 GiB magnetic storage, $5 a month current pricing (not SSD which would be $10 a month)
* security Group I named 001, open ports: 22 (ssh), 3389 (rdp)

### Lubuntu Desktop

https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/lubuntu-desktop

Update the list of packages (always do this before installing anything)
```
sudo apt-get update
```

Install the lubuntu-desktop package.  The -y will answer yes to everything.
```
sudo apt-get install -y lubuntu-desktop
```

### RDP

The rdp version on Ubuntu 16.04 looks to be old 0.6 versus the current of 0.9.  I went ahead and went with the 0.6 figuring that Ubuntu knows best.  May look into upgrading it later.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xrdp
```

You probably won't have an ~/.xsession file.  If not create one as follows.  If you have one, back it up, delete it, and create a new one as follows:
```
echo "lxsession -e LXDE -s Lubuntu" | tee ~/.xsession
```
Check the /etc/xrdp directory for a file named startwm.sh  This file controls the starting of the windows manager.  It should look similar to this.  The last line is crucial because it tells it to use Xsession which will use our ~/.xsession file we just created.
```
#!/bin/sh

if [ -r /etc/default/locale ]; then
  . /etc/default/locale
  export LANG LANGUAGE
fi

. /etc/X11/Xsession
```

Restart the xrdp service so it will read and use our ~/.xsession file we just created.
```
sudo service xrdp restart
```
