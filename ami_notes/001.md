### My personal notes for creating the KevinCrook.com 001 AWS AMI

This AMI provides the following:

* Ubuntu Server - AWS does not provide any Linux desktops

* Lubuntu Desktop - allows students to run the desktop in the cloud

* RDP - remote desktop protocol - allows students to connect to the Lubuntu Desktop using Microsoft Remote Desktop

* Chrome Browser - allows students to run Jupyter Notebook, etc.

* Anaconda distribution: Python 3.x and 2.x, R, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda Navigator, etc.

* SageMath - both command line and activation for Jupyter Notebook

* Docker - this should allow students to run any Docker images used in any of their classes, including Hadoop, Spark, etc.
